## Hi, CodeLeap team👋

**This 'organization' is for the development challenge (enginnering test):**

🙋‍♀️ The test for the job vacancy is for the position of Junior Backend Engineer, but I would like to increase the frontend to prove my skills.

👩‍💻 The project documentation is also available in this [repository](https://github.com/codeleap-challenge/codeleap.docs).
